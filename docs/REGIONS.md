## List of supported regions
### Scraping modules that support regions
* screenscraper (pretty much all resources)
* igdb (only release date)
* mobygames (only cover artwork)

Please note that not all regions are supported by all modules (support is noted inside the `()` for each country or region). And only certain resources from those modules can be extracted with a specific country or region (see above).

When setting the country or region use the short-name as shown. Check the examples further down.

## Examples
### Command line
`--region de`
### ~/.skyscraper/config.ini
```
[main]
region="de"
```
or
```
[any platform]
region="de"
```

## Other notes
### Region autodetection
Skyscraper will try to autodetect the region from the file name. It will look for designations such as `(Europe)` or `(e)` and set the region accordingly. This currently works for the following regions and / or countries:
* eu
* us
* wor
* jp
* br
* kr
* tw
* fr
* de
* it
* sp
* cn
* au
* se
* ca
* nl
* dk
* asi

### Default region prioritization
When a region is specified by the user, this region will be prioritized. However, if a resource can't be found with that specific region, it will fall back to the default list of regions and look for a resource with the topmost region first, then the next and so on:
* eu
* us
* uk
* wor
* jp
* au
* ame
* de
* cus
* cn
* kr
* asi
* br
* sp
* fr
* gr
* it
* no
* dk
* nz
* nl
* pl
* ru
* se
* tw

### Override default region prioritization list
It is also possible to completely override the default prioritization list with the `regionPrios="<COMMASEPARATED REGION LIST>"` config.ini option. This can *not* be done on command-line.

#### Examples
##### ~/.skyscraper/config.ini
```
[main]
regionPrios="de,us,jp"
```
or
```
[any platform]
regionPrios="de,us,jp"
```
